#The upper bound is the first position where a number greater than the target can be inserted.

#If the target exists, it points to the position after the last occurrence of the target.

#If the target doesnâ€™t exist, it points to the position where the target would be 
# inserted after all elements smaller or equal to it.

#"Where can I place a number strictly larger than the target?"
